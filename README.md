# MotoGPCalendarAPI
This is my first "from scratch" web API. I have build it by reading different resources and documentation.
I will be grateful if you provide any feedback so I can improve.

.Net Core 2.2 API with C#.
Database: Code-first with Entity Framework Core and MySQL running in Docker.
API Documentation with Swagger.

You can find documents with the resources I have used and personal annotations in the folder named "MotoGPCalendar Information".
You will always find the latest changes in this folder in the branch "documentation" created from "master".

Thank you!
